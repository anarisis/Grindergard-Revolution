# Changelog
All changes to Grindergard Revolution will be documented in this file. The format is informed by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Version number structuring is inspired by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and can be read as follows: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH(HOTFIX)

Major and Minor updates and Patches are all declared with ascending whole numbers, and Hotfixes are declared with ascending alphabetical numbers. Major updates add gameplay features or otherwise significantly effect the experience of play and are not compatible with clients/servers of differing versions. Minor updates contain fixes and changes that are not compatible with clients/servers of differing versions. Patches contain fixes and changes that are significant but are intercompatible with clients/servers running packs of the same major and minor version. Hotfixes include only minor fixes and are intercompatible with clients/servers running packs of the same major and minor version, and these changes are included in the event of a subsequent patch.


*Example:* v1.2.0a *indicates a hotfix for the 1st major version with its 2nd minor update before any patches.*
